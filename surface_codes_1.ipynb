Surface codes are a way of encoding logical qubits into several physical qubits and use topological properties of the connectivity of the qubits to protect against errors. One connection we will need to make clear from the beginning is a connection to number theory and combinatorial topology via so-called \"ribbon graphs\" or \"dessins d'enfants\". "

    "Now, we are going to need a combinatorial tool often called a **dessin d'enfant, ribbon graph, combinatorial map, or rotation systems**. The term dessin d'enfant is a French term meaning \"child's drawing\" which was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in the contect of studying number theory, alegraic geomerty, and Riemann surfaces, so it is often most used in these constexts. The term \"ribbon graph\" is more often used by the physics community, but these are all essentially equivalent notions. This combinatorial tool shows up in the context of studying quantum gravity, for example in a paper by Maxim Kontsevich \"Intersection Theory on the Moduli Space of Curves and the Matrix Airy Function\". Other examples can be found in the work of Edward Witten, for example in \"Volumes and Random Matrices and Developments in Topological Gravity\"."

We define two permutations, $\\sigma, \\alpha$ such that $\\sigma, \\alpha \\in S_{2n}$. The permutation $\\phi = (\\sigma \\alpha)^{-1}$ then gives us a triple $[\\sigma, \\alpha, \\phi]$ which defines a **constellation**.

This replacement also automatically means every vertex in the original grapht is replaced by a face in the dual graph. The dual graph lies on the same surface and thus has the same genus. Moreover, we can compute the corresponding constellation by simply exchanging $\\sigma$ and $\\phi$. The notion of a dual graph will be important in the construction of surface codes because the qubits in a surface code will correspond to the vertices, edges, and faces of a dessin and its dual graph, just as the dual graph is used in [Quantum Computation with Topological Codes: from qubit to topological fault-tolerance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01444.pdf), another very important reference for this notebook. Our construction will provide usual surface codes, just as those defined in this reference, but we also provide a way of constructing hybrid qudit surface codes, a new less written about kind of surface code.

    "## Boundary and Coboundary Operators for Surface Code Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to define \"boundary operators\" on dessins/surface code graphs. Boundary operators act on \"chains\" and for us, chains will be lists of faces, edges, or vertices. They can be thought of as elements in a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, but this can be interpreted as the element either being present in the list (coefficient $1$) or not in the list (coefficient $0$). So we don't really need to use the linear algebra perspective yet. The boundary operator $\\partial_2:F \\to E$ (faces to edges) takes faces to the edges that surround them, i.e. to the boundary of the face. Similarly, the boundary operator $\\partial_1:E \\to V$ (edges to vertices) take edges to the vertices attached to their ends. The boundary of a vertex (node) in a surface code graph is always $0$. Remember for a constellation $[\\sigma, \\alpha, \\phi]$ we get a bipartite graph on a surface. Now, we will consider the \"white nodes\" labeled by pairs in $\\alpha$ as the edge labels. The black nodes labeled by $\\phi$ in the surface code graph will be the \"faces\". The black nodes labeled by $\\sigma$ will be the \"vertices\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a \"coboundary\" operator $\\delta_2:E \\to F$ (edges to faces) that computes the faces lying on either side of an edge. For the \"stars\" of the graph labeled by $\\sigma$ there is a coboundary operator $\\delta_1:V \\to E$ (vertices to edges) which computes the edges attached to a vertex labeled by $\\sigma$. The two boundary operators that will be most important and used most often will be $\\partial_2$ and $\\delta_1$ operating on faces and stars respectively, but we're going to define all four of the boundary and coboundary operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary and coboundary operators  can then be used to define Pauli-operators corresponding to cycles and cocyles in the surface code graph. We will discuss this more once we have defined the boundary and coboundary operators. Let's start by defining $\\partial_2$ and $\\delta_1$."

On the other hand if there are an odd number of occurence of an edge, that edge does show up in the output. This reflects the $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$-chain complex structure. This can all be phrased in terms of linear algebra and treating $V$, $E$, and $F$ as vector spaces over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.
