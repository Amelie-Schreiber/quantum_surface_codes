    "In this notebook we are going to implement the HybridSurfaceCodeGraph class which allows us to create surface codes with qudits of varying dimensions. The dimensions depend on the lengths of permutations given by a dessin d'enfant (given by a constellation $[\\sigma, \\alpha, \\phi]$. The permuation $\\sigma$ gives the vertices of the graph of the dessin which is cellularly embedded in a Riemann surface. Each cycle of $\\sigma$ has a length and determines a qudit (or infinite periodic/cyclic harmonic oscillator) of the same dimension/period as the length of the cycle of $\\sigma$. Similarly, each cycle of $\\phi$ determines a face of the embedded graph and determines a qudit of the same dimension as the length of the cycle of $\\phi$. The nodes corresponding to cycles in $\\alpha$ are all $2$-cycles and so define qubits, i.e. $2$-level systems (such as electrons). The coefficients in this implementation are in $\\mathbb{Z}$ as apposed to the usual $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients used in standard qubit surface codes (ex. Kitaev's torus code). Because the dimension of each qudit in the surface code is different it is not clear what other coefficient might be useful. One may at some point want coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ where $N = d_1^{n_1}d_2^{n_2} \\cdots d_k^{n_k}$, where the $d_j^{n_j}$ are the dimensions of the qudits in the surface code. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Abelian Groups this would naturally decompose into a direct product of groups"

    "This may be implemented later on if there seems to be a need, but currently is not implemented and we just use $\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients.
