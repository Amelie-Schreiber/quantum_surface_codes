See Example 2.14 pg. 21 of [Raeburn](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/_media/ma8107/2014h/iain_raeburn_cbmsnov2_.pdf) give the construction of graph $C^*$-algebras associated to cyclic quivers. The tensor product of these algebras can be associated to infinite cyclic harmonic oscillators similar to t'Hooft's cogwheel model (but infinite periodic).
