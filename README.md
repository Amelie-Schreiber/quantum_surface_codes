For a pullback of graph $C^*$-algebras 

$$A \to \prod_{\sigma_x \in \sigma} M_{n(x)}(C(S^1)) \to B$$

where $B \subset \prod_{\sigma_x \in \sigma} \mathbb{T}^{n(x)}$, we associate a tensor product algebra $\bigotimes{\sigma_x \in \sigma}M_{n(x)}(C(S^1))$, in particular, there is a natural pullback algebra known as a gentle surface algebra uniquely associated to each graph cellularly embedded in a Riemann surface. Likewise, there is a unique "hybrid qudit surface code" or "chymera code" associated to each graph cellularly embedded in the surface. We treat such algebras as dual to each other in the sense of a ring of functions (on a space say) is dual its spectrum. 

We can think of walks in the universal covering quiver (with relations) as walks along the surface (dessin d'enfant) obeying certain rules (respecting the relations of the quiver). This can also be seen as the propogation of Pauli string operators in the chymera code. This duality gives connections to noncommutative geometry, and to number theory. In particular, noncommutative tori are instantiated locally as subalgebras of the local factors $M_{n(x)}(C(S^1))$ associated to each qudit.
