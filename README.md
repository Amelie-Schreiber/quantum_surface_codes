## Graph C^*-algebras as Operator Algebras for Entangled Cyclic Harmonic Oscillators

See Example 2.14 pg. 21 of [Raeburn](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/_media/ma8107/2014h/iain_raeburn_cbmsnov2_.pdf) give the construction of graph $C^*$-algebras associated to cyclic quivers. These algebras can be associated to infinite cyclic harmonic oscillators similar to [t'Hooft's cogwheel model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1548). 

See also these [notes](http://www.waltervansuijlekom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/thesisRichardBSc.pdf) and [these](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9912130.pdf)

## Knowledge Graphs and Graph States

Using the notebook on [graph states from text](https://github.com/Amelie-Schreiber/quantum_surface_codes/blob/main/graph_state_from_text.ipynb), we can associate a quantum graph state to a knowledge graph extracted from text. From there, we can use the notebook on [The Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Network](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qgrnn.html) to study the "physics of knowledge graphs". In particular, this could be used for link prediction of knowledge graphs.
